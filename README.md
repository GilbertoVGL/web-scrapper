A node.js web-scrapper.

This is a web scrapper builded with JavaScript, Node.js, Vue.js, using technologies I actually work with.

Steps:

  1 - Select the type of data you want to look for, there are four types;
  
    1.1 - Images from google images;
    
    1.2 - Images from a given website;
    
    1.3 - Car prices from OLX, then you must give car name/model;
    
    1.4 - Realtys prices from OLX (at this given moment it's only looking for realtys in Goi√¢nia, for a specific purpose)
    
    
To Run:

  Clone the repository;
