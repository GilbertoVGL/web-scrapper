# web-scrapper
A node.js web-scrapper.

This is a web scrapper builded with JavaScript, Node.js, Vue.js, using technologies I actually work with.

Steps:

  1 - Select the type of data you want to look for, there are four types;
  
    1.1 - Images from google images;
    
    1.2 - Images from a given website;
    
    1.3 - Car prices from OLX, then you must give car name/model;
    
    1.4 - Realtys prices from OLX (at this given moment it's only looking for realtys in Goi√¢nia, for a specific purpose)
    
obs.: For purposes of development of the tools, only option 1.4 is currently working.
To Run:

  Clone the repository;
  
  go to the client folder and run npm install;
  
  go to the server folder and run npm install;

  you'll need docker and docker-compose installed in order to run the project.
  after you get it installed: 
  
  - Go to the project root folder and run docker-compose up;
  
  - Go to client folder and run npm run dev;

  - Go to server folder (if you have nodemon installed) run nodemon -w ./ ;


TO DO's :
  - [ ] Make realtyPrices.js service a cron job;
  - [ ] Determine the periodicity the reatyPrices cron job will run;
  - [ ] Work on the user interface;
  - [ ] Make analytics graphics from the realty data took;
  - [ ] Make reports for the user;
  - [ ] Make a way to the user specify the parameters of the realty he wants to look for;
  - [ ] Currently only taking realtys in Gyn with a higher rent price of R$ 1.300, should I make it a user choice? If so, have to study OLX url patterns to insert it on my search;
  - [ ] Do it, but do it good.
